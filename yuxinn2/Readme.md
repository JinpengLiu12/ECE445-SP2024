# Jerry's ECE445 Lab Notebook

## 2/6: First team meeting with TA

Pre-meeting

highlevel requirement
 
1. The machine will properly dispense correct amount of pill for most common size pill.
2. The machine will be able to dispense medication & alert  at preset schedule.
3. The machine will have a functional app interface and communicate with machine via bluetooth.


subsystem requirements 

the backup power is usable and won't affect the performance of the system. 
other subsystems are mostly covered by high-level requirement

  **meeting info <br>**
  •  went throught the overall project
     • from objective to implementation. still have questions about implementation, thinking about ways to implement the dispensing system.   


## 2/13: Second team meeting with TA

1. went through the proposal submitted last week, now have a clean objective, high level requirement and RV table.
