# Jerry's ECE445 Lab Notebook

## 2/6: First team meeting with TA

Pre-meeting

highlevel requirement
 
1. The machine will properly dispense correct amount of pill for most common size pill.
2. The machine will be able to dispense medication & alert  at preset schedule.
3. The machine will have a functional app interface and communicate with machine via bluetooth.


subsystem requirements 

the backup power is usable and won't affect the performance of the system. 
other subsystems are mostly covered by high-level requirement

  **meeting info <br>**
  •  went throught the overall project
     • from objective to implementation. still have questions about implementation, thinking about ways to implement the dispensing system.   


## 2/13: Second team meeting with TA

1. went through the proposal submitted last week, now have a clean objective, high level requirement and RV table.

## 2/20:third team meeting with TA
1. went through design doc
2. prepare to present for design review

 **Plan <br>**
  • Discuss in more detail the microcontroller and sensor integration <br>
  • Started Considering the PCB design <br>
  
## 3/5: Component Identification and Ordering
  • Finalized and ordered essential components:<br>
    Microcontroller:esp32. <br>
    Weight sensor: HX711 <br>
    Stepper motor: drv8825 <br>
    Ordered the needed parts. <br>
  **Plan <br>**
  • Design and create a printed circuit board (PCB) for the microcontroller and stepper motor. <br>
  
## 3/12: Component Testing
  • Conducted initial tests on motors and temperature sensors using an Arduino. <br>
  **Plan <br>**
  • Place an order for the PCB designed for the microcontroller and stepper motor. <br>
